    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Got Chips LLC is a small, engineering‑focused machine shop built around curiosity, precision, and a genuine love for making things. We help people turn ideas into real, functional parts — whether it’s a one‑off prototype or a small production run.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We’re a hands‑on shop that believes in clear communication, practical engineering, and doing things the right way. When you work with us, you talk directly to the person machining your parts — no layers, no confusion, no surprises.</p>

    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>Got Chips LLC was created to make high‑quality machining accessible and friendly. Too many shops feel intimidating or hard to approach. We wanted to build something different — a place where people feel comfortable asking questions, exploring ideas, and building cool things.</p>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We communicate clearly and honestly</li>
      <li>We focus on practical, real‑world solutions</li>
      <li>We iterate quickly and efficiently</li>
      <li>We care about the details that matter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’re looking for a shop that’s easy to work with and serious about quality, you’re in the right place.</p>
