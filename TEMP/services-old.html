    <h1>Services</h1>
    <p>We help turn ideas into real, functional parts. Whether you’re early in development or ready for production, we offer practical, engineering‑driven support at every step.</p>

    <h2>CNC Machining</h2>
    <p>High‑quality machining for prototypes, functional parts, and small production runs. Clean finishes, tight tolerances, and reliable results.</p>

    <h2>Prototype Development</h2>
    <p>Still refining your design? No problem. We help you iterate quickly, catch issues early, and get to a working part faster.</p>

    <h2>DFM (Design for Manufacturability)</h2>
    <p>We look at your design from a machinist’s perspective and help simplify, strengthen, and reduce cost without compromising function.</p>

    <h2>Reverse Engineering</h2>
    <p>Have a part but no drawing? We can recreate it, improve it, or adapt it for modern machining processes.</p>

    <h2>Fixture + Tooling Design</h2>
    <p>Custom fixtures and modular setups designed for real‑world shop use. Practical, efficient, and built to make machining easier.</p>

    <h2>Small‑Batch Production</h2>
    <p>When you need more than a prototype but not a full production run, we can bridge the gap with consistent, repeatable machining.</p>
